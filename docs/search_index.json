"],["objective.html", "Section 2 Objective", " Section 2 Objective A complex web of regulations and other constraints limit the extent and intensity of forest treatment application (Van Deusen et al., 2012; North et al., 2015; Lydersen et al., 2019). Physical-environment, socioeconomic, and regulatory factors alone or in combination affect what type of treatment is practical or allowed in different areas. The objective of this study is to spatially identify the treatable area and the constraints on management activities in western USFS managed forests and the 21 priority landscapes outlined in the USFS Wildfire Crisis Strategy (USFS). Specific questions asked in this analysis are: i) What is the spatial extent on which management is constrained? ii) Which constraining factor(s) — physical-environment, socioeconomic, regulatory — is most limiting to forest management? "],["data-sources.html", "Section 3 Data Sources", " Section 3 Data Sources The data utilized for this analysis was generated in Google Earth Engine using this script. This program outputs 1) a data table of features - USDA Forest Service (USFS) managed forests - with user-defined constraints to forest managment and the reduction in treatable forested area based on those constraints, and 2) a shapefile of the spatial arrangement of treatable and constrained forested area within the boundary of each feature. The data products used in this study include: The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) was used to define forested area based on 2019 classification at 30m. The PAD-US product was used to identify protected areas that are dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreation and cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The USGS 3DEP Seamless National Map (10m) was used to determine slope. The USFWS Threatened &amp; Endangered Species Active Critical Habitat Report was used to determin the proposed and final critical habitat for species listed as Threatened and Endangered by the FWS, or that are jointly managed by FWS/NMFS. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) was used to define the United States water drainage network made up of stream features and waterbody polygons. Road and Trail networks were determined utilizing: The United States Census Bureau TIGER dataset (2016 release) The USFS FACTS database products: Motor Vehicle Use Map: Roads; Motor Vehicle Use Map: Trails; National Forest System Roads; National Forest System Trails "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
